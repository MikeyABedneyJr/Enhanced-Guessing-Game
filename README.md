Enhanced guessing game:

This was a CodeFellows assignment to take a random number guessing game and spruce it up visually and functionally.
jQuery added the button and the ability to tell when someone typed in letters instead of numbers.

Fixes needed:
*The button will not process whether your guess was too high or low.  I tried putting the if/else statements in different places, trying to nest the function.  I was unsuccessful.

*Take out the greyed code that sets the answer equal to 10 rather than randomizing it (this was set for testing purposes only)
